# GetFile

Target: Build an application that downloads part of a file from a web server, in chunks.

Context: This is a simplified version of a “download booster”, which speeds up downloads by requesting
files in multiple pieces simultaneously (saturating the network), then reassembling the pieces.

Why: This is a simple application that has some coding and some networking, but both parts are
straightforward. Even if you are not familiar with networking, the APIs and concepts are pretty simple
so you should be able to complete this in a few hours.
What we’ll be looking at: Whether you met all the requirements, how you solved the problem, how
clear your code is, how you chose to structure your program, how easy your program is to use, and how
you communicate the design decisions you made (in code/comments).
